# Requirement Prioritization

Prioritization ensures teams deliver the highest business value first.

## Why it matters

- Scope is always larger than available time.
- Not all requirements have equal impact.
- Prioritized backlogs reduce delivery risk.

## Common prioritization methods

- MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)
- Kano model
- Value vs Effort matrix

## Practical steps for BAs

- Confirm business goals for the release.
- Align with product, tech, and QA on dependencies.
- Mark requirements that unblock other work.
- Re-prioritize after every sprint review.
