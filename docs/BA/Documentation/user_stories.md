# User Stories

In an agile development environment, a user story is a document describing the functionality a business system should provide and are written from the perspective of an end-user/customer/client.

The user stories are not very descriptive and only captures ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘why’ of a requirement in limited detail. If any requirement is too big for a single user story, it’s broken down into a number of user stories making it easier for estimation and discussion. In such cases, the main user story will act as an Epic (parent) user story.

Some examples of user stories are:
- The system shall be able to sort the values in ascending and descending order
- The application must allow the user to enter his name, date of birth, and address.
- The system shall verify the user’s login credentials and redirect him to the dashboard in case of a successful login.
