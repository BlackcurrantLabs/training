## Business Requirements Document(BRD)
A Business Requirement Document is created to describe the business requirements of a product/process and the intended end result that is expected from the product/process. It is one of the most widely accepted project requirement documents and is referred to throughout the development life-cycle for any project.

A BRD mainly focuses on answering ‘what is the business solution’ as opposed to ‘how to achieve the business solution’ and thus, it’s mainly centered around the business requirements.

A BRD is created with the help of the project team (BA, client, subject matter experts, business partners) and is also used as a communication tool for other stakeholders/external service providers.

The Business Requirement Document contains:

- Project Background
- Business goals and objectives
- Stakeholders
- Requirement scope
- Functional requirements
- Data requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Interface requirements
- Business glossary/Definitions
- Dependencies of existing systems
- Assumptions
