# Requirement Gathering

Requirement gathering is a process of understanding what needs to be developed and the reason behind developing the product or services. Basically, as a business analyst, your role is to understand the pain point of the client and the problems they are facing in the current environment. Thus, understanding why they want to build a product or a service in place. Defining the project requirement’s scope and goals early on during the project initiation can help you solve the risk factors and issues much more intuitively than without proper understanding.

Business analysts, system analysts, product owners, and project managers are mainly responsible for meeting with stakeholders and clients and jotting down the project’s requirements, goals, and scope.
