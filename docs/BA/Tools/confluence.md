# Confluence

Create, collaborate, and organize all your work in one place. Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet. Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and collaborate on any project or idea. Spaces help your team structure, organize, and share work, so every team member has visibility into institutional knowledge and access to the information they need to do their best work. Confluence is for teams of any size and type, from those with mission-critical, high-stakes projects that need rigor behind their practices, to those that are looking for a space to build team culture and engage with one another in a more open and authentic way. Equipped with Confluence, your team can make quick decisions, gain alignment, and accomplish more together. 


## Key Terms

    - Page

Your content lives in pages – living documents you create on your Confluence site. You can create pages for almost anything, from project plans to meeting notes, troubleshooting guides, policies, and more. Confluence comes bundled with templates to help you make beautiful pages for almost any kind of content. If you can’t find a template for the type of content you want to create, you can always start with a blank page.

    - Space

Pages are stored in spaces – workspaces where you can collaborate on work and keep all your content organized. It’s best to group related content together in the same space, but you can create as many or as few spaces as your team needs. For example, one marketing team might keep all of its work in one space, with a page for each campaign, while another might set up a separate space for every single campaign. Each space comes with an overview (or homepage) and a blog, so it’s easy to share updates and announcements with your whole team.

    - Page tree

Organize space content with a hierarchical page tree that makes finding work quick and easy. Nest pages under related spaces and pages to organize pages in just about any way.
