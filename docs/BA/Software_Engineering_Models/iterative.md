The Iterative Model relies on specifying and implementing individual parts of the software, rather than attempting to start with full specification requirements. Once a rough product is created within an iteration, it is then reviewed and improved in the next iteration and so on. The Iterative Model relies on the whole product being developed step-by-step (Design/Develop, Test, Implement).
