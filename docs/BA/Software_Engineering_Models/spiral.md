The spiral model is a risk-driven process model. This SDLC model helps the group to adopt elements of one or more process models like a waterfall, incremental, waterfall, etc. The spiral technique is a combination of rapid prototyping and concurrency in design and development activities.

Each cycle in the spiral begins with the identification of objectives for that cycle, the different alternatives that are possible for achieving the goals, and the constraints that exist. This is the first quadrant of the cycle (upper-left quadrant).

The next step in the cycle is to evaluate these different alternatives based on the objectives and constraints. The focus of evaluation in this step is based on the risk perception for the project.

The next step is to develop strategies that solve uncertainties and risks. This step may involve activities such as benchmarking, simulation, and prototyping.
