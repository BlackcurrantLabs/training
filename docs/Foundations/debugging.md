# Debugging Fundamentals

Debugging is a core engineering skill. Treat it as a method, not trial and error.

## Practical debugging flow

1. Reproduce the issue reliably.
2. Narrow the failure boundary.
3. Check logs, traces, and recent changes.
4. Form a hypothesis and test it.
5. Fix root cause, not symptoms.
6. Add tests and monitoring to prevent recurrence.

## What to use

- Structured logs
- Breakpoints and step-through debugging
- Network inspectors
- Database query inspection
- Error tracking tools
