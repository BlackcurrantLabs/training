Typescript is the natural evolution of Javascript. Any javascript is by default valid typescript.
Typescript optionally adds support for types such that variables once declared as a datatype like string cannot be re-assigned an integer value. This approach can catch potential errors while developing itself, thus avoiding sleepless nights debugging where things went wrong.

All the features you've learned so far like Promises and Async/Await are all valid in Typescript as well.

Typescript code is transpiled by `tsc` *Typescript Compiler* to native javascript.
