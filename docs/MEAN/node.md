# NodeJs

Node is an execution environment for Javascript.
npm stands for Node Package Manager which is a tool used to manage dependencies just like maven or gradle for java or pip for python.

Node always runs in a single process and thread by default. The way it's able to manage sumiltanious connections is via something called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ&ab_channel=JSConf">event loop</a>.

You will not be able to fully appreciate the event loop till you've dived a little more into ES6 language features.
