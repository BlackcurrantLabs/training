# NodeJs

Node is an execution environment for Javascript.
npm stands for Node Package Manager which is a tool used to manage dependencies just like maven or gradle for java or pip for python.

Node always runs in a single process and thread by default. The way it's able to manage sumiltanious connections is via something called Event Loop.

You will not be able to fully appreciate the event loop till you've dived a little more into ES6 language features, so make sure you've completed that section first.

This video does a really good job at explaining the event loop.
