# Javascript ES6

Javascipt was initally only limited to the browser running very minimal functions, but today we can use Javascript to even on the backend using execution frameworks like nodeJs.

This is great because you now don't have to master two languages (one for frontend and one for backend) to become a full stack engineer anymore.

While node is not the best on performace on the serverside, it can be tuned to be pretty good and will work for most scenarios. 

The wide range of open source packages available in npm makes it a really attractive choice for web development.

There are a few crucial language features which you have to learn to write good code both on the frontend and backend.

## Promises


## Async / Await


## RxJS
