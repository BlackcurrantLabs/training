!!! note "How to use"

    At Blackcurrant, we don't believe in spoon feeding. Lifelong learning will be a part of your life here. To suppliment this, this site is created to be a loose syllabus which points new joinees in the right direction.

    This Repository does not include any documentation itself, but only links to training resources. This guide will help you get acquainted with the tools and frameworks we use at Blackcurrant so you can join and be a productive memeber of the team right away.

!!! info "Skip Sections"

    You may skip the sections that you already know, We're trying to make this a guide from 0 to mastery.

!!! tldr "Resources"

    Most pages have a resources section that has links to official sources or project documentation. Documentation is always the holy grail and reading through this will expose you to many concepts which might never be covered in youtube videos.

!!! danger "Tutorial Hell"

    While youtube videos are a qick way to get started, they often lack the depth of knowledge that actual documentation provides. **DO NOT** rely on videos only, they are merely there to provide an overview and do not constitute the full syllabus.

    Do not go through these sections with an **exam oriented mindset**. These are real world tools that you're going to use day in and day out.
    Go at your own pace, really experiment on your own code as much as possible, learn with the only intention to improve your skills.

### Choose your area of specilization

There is a saying which goes like *"Jack of all trades, master of none."*. The technology landscape it too vast today for a single human to comprehend even if they study all through their life. But that's a useless endeavour because you'll never be able to become productive.

While knowing multiple concepts is important, so is choosing your specialization. You should ideally be at a position where you know your field with great detail but are still able to comprehend what your collegues mean when there is a project related discussion happening.

Gaining depth of knowledge of your field is of primary importance, having a working understanding of what your collegues are doing is the next priority.
So it's getter to go ahead with a modified saying, **"Jack of all trades, master of *Some*."**
