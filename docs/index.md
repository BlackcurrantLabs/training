# Welcome to blackcurrant training

This is a simple repository of the learning path to become a **Full Stack Developer**.
All the critical components (Database, Frontend Framework, Backend Framework) will be covered.
The resources are mentioned in the order they have to be learned as there will be a dependency on previously learned concepts.

!!! note "How to use"

    At Blackcurrant, we don't believe in spoon-feeding. Lifelong learning will be a part of your life here. To supplement this, this site is created to be a loose syllabus that points freshers in the right direction.
    
    This Repository does not include any documentation itself, but only links to training resources. This guide will help you get acquainted with the tools and frameworks we use at Blackcurrant so you can join and be a productive member of the team right away.

!!! info "Skip Sections"

    You may skip the sections that you already know or are irrelevant to your field.

!!! tldr "Resources"

    Most pages have a resources section that has links to official sources or project documentation. Documentation is always the holy grail and reading through this will expose you to many concepts which might never be covered in youtube videos.

!!! success "Courses"

    Some sections have a course linked to them. These courses are free and you're expected to complete them and add that course certificate to your profile.
    All the courses mentioned here are small and you should be able to comlete them well before the paid tier starts

!!! danger "Tutorial Hell"

    While youtube videos are a quick way to get started, they often lack the depth of knowledge that actual documentation provides. **DO NOT** rely on videos only, they are merely there to provide an overview and do not constitute the full syllabus.

    Do not go through these sections with an **exam-oriented mindset**. These are real-world tools that you're going to use day in and day out.
    Go at your own pace, really experiment with your own code as much as possible, and learn with the only intention to improve your skills.

### Choose your area of specilization

There is a saying which goes *"Jack of all trades, master of none."*. The technology landscape is too vast today for a single human to comprehend even if they study all through their life. But that's a useless endeavor because you'll never be able to become productive.

While knowing multiple concepts is important, so is choosing your specialization. You should ideally be in a position where you know your field with great detail but are still able to comprehend what your colleagues mean when there is a project-related discussion happening.

Gaining depth of knowledge in your field is of primary importance, and having a working understanding of what your colleagues are doing is the next priority.
So it's better to go ahead with a modified saying, **"Jack of all trades, master of *Some*."**
