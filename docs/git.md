## Branching Strategy
Using a branching strategy is crucial to be on the same page with your team. 
The actual branching strategy used will vary from project to project and will be handed to you by your team lead.

## Pull request essentials

- Keep PRs focused on one problem.
- Explain what changed and why.
- Link issue/ticket references.
- Add testing notes and screenshots where relevant.
- Respond to review comments with clear updates.

## Commit message basics

- Use meaningful subject lines.
- Mention *what* changed, not just *fixed stuff*.
- Keep unrelated changes in separate commits.
