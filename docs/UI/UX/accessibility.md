# Accessibility Basics

Accessible design improves usability for everyone and is a core product requirement.

## Key principles (WCAG)

- Perceivable: users can identify content and controls
- Operable: interface works with keyboard and assistive tools
- Understandable: labels, errors, and flows are clear
- Robust: works across devices, browsers, and assistive tech

## Practical checklist

- Use sufficient color contrast.
- Provide alt text for meaningful images.
- Keep heading hierarchy correct.
- Ensure full keyboard navigation.
- Add clear labels and error messages to forms.
