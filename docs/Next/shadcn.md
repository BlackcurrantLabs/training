# shadcn/ui

**shadcn/ui** is NOT a component library. It is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Key Concepts

- **Ownership**: You own the code. The components are added to your project (usually in `components/ui`), and you can customize them as needed.
- **Foundation**: It is built on top of **Radix UI** (for accessible, headless primitives) and **Tailwind CSS** (for styling).

- **Docs**: [https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
