# Drizzle ORM

**Drizzle ORM** is a lightweight, type-safe TypeScript ORM.

- **What**: It allows you to define your database schema in TypeScript and query it with a fluent API.
- **Why**: It is known for its performance and "SQL-like" feel.
- **Docs**: [https://orm.drizzle.team/](https://orm.drizzle.team/)

!!! info "Status"
We have used Drizzle in the past, but we are currently standardizing on **Prisma** for new projects due to its developer experience and syntax preferences.
