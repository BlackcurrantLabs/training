# Tables

Building complex tables (sorting, filtering, pagination) from scratch is error-prone. We use **TanStack Table** (formerly React Table).

## TanStack Table

- **What**: A headless UI library for building tables. It provides the logic, you provide the UI.
- **Integration**: We often use it in combination with **shadcn/ui** table components to render the actual markup.
