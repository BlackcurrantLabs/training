# Forms

Handling forms in React can be verbose. To simplify state management, validation, and error handling, we use standard libraries.

## React Hook Form

We use **React Hook Form** for managing form state. It is performant, flexible, and reduces the amount of code needed to build forms.

## Zod

We use **Zod** for schema validation. It integrates seamlessly with React Hook Form to provide type-safe validation.
