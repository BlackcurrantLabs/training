# React Query (TanStack Query)

**TanStack Query** (formerly React Query) is the standard for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in your web applications.

## Why use it?

- **Server State Management**: Handles loading, error, and success states automatically.
- **Caching**: Caches data to avoid unnecessary requests.
- **Deduping**: Dedupes multiple requests for the same data.
- **Background Updates**: Keeps data fresh in the background.

It is particularly useful in **Client Components** where you need to fetch data from an API.
