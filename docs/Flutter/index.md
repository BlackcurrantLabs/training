Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled applications. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. 

Flutter code compiles to ARM or Intel machine code as well as JavaScript, for fast performance on any device. Take control of your codebase with automated testing, developer tooling, and everything else you need to build production-quality apps
