This repository is a collection of trining material for new joinees. It does not need to have the actual documentation, but it should cover the necesssary topics with links to official documentation.
For each topic it should give a small summary of what it is, where it's used and links to official documentation or videos on youtube which explain the topic well.
Always write in markdown only. This repository is built with mkdocs. To edit main index, update mkdocs.yml in root, and add pages in docs/ directory.
