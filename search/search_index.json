Usually, a persona is presented in a one or two-page document (like the one you can see in the example below). Such 1\u20132-page descriptions include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which a persona operates. Designers usually create user persona template templates, which include a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character (e.g. quotes of real users), as well as context-specific details (for example, for a banking app it makes sense to include a persona\u2019s financial sophistication and major expenses).</p> <p> User persona template.
